# Introduction

Lazurite is an unofficial shader development tool for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with RenderDragon graphics engine, which focuses on intuitive use and powerful features.

GitHub page: <https://github.com/veka0/lazurite>

PyPi page: <https://pypi.org/project/lazurite>

## Installation

Lazurite requires to have Python 3.10+ installed, but 3.12 is recommended.

Official python installation page: <https://www.python.org/downloads>.
Windows users are recommended to install Python from Microsoft Store.

After installing python, you can install lazurite package from [pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/lazurite), with a command

```sh
pip install lazurite
```

or

```sh
python -m pip install lazurite
```

???warning "Termux installation error"

    If during Lazurite installation on Termux (Android) you encounter this error:

    ```
    aarch64-linux-android-clang++: error: unknown argument: '-fno-openmp-implicit-rpath'
          error: command '/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-android-clang++' failed with exit code 1
          note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

    ERROR: Failed building wheel for pyjson5
    Failed to build pycryptodome pyjson5
    ERROR: Could not build wheels for pycryptodome, pyjson5, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects
    ```

    It can be fixed by running the following commands (as suggested [here](<https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/20039#issuecomment-2096494418>)):

    ```sh
    _file="$(find $PREFIX/lib/python3.11 -name "_sysconfigdata*.py")"
    rm -rf $PREFIX/lib/python3.11/__pycache__
    cp $_file "$_file".backup
    sed -i 's|-fno-openmp-implicit-rpath||g' "$_file"
    ```
